### Tarball, Rsync & S3 Cache Kit for Buildkite. Supports Linux and macOS.

_(Windows is on the way)_

A [Buildkite plugin](https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/plugins) to restore and save
directories by cache keys. For example, use the checksum of a `.resolved` or `.lock` file
to restore/save built dependencies between independent builds, not just jobs.

With tarball or rsync, if source folder has changes, this will not fail your build, instead will surpress, notify and continue.

For S3, Instead of sync thousands of files, It just creates a tarball before S3 operation then copy this tarball to s3 at one time. This will reduce both time and cost on AWS billing.

Plus, In addition to tarball & rsync, we also do not re-create another tarball for same cache key if it's already exists.

## ðŸš¨ Breaking Change

Please see usages below to adopt new `v2.2.x` branch. Please use `v2.1.0` or older to keep old syntax.

## Backends

Please see `lib/backends/*.sh` for available backends. You can fork, add your backend then send a PR here.

Available backends and their requirements:

| **Backend** | **Linux (GNU)**                             | **macOS (BSD)**                             | **Windows** |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `tarball`   | tar<br />sha1sum                            | tar<br />shasum                             | -           |
| `rsync`     | rsync<br />sha1sum                          | rsync <br />shasum                          | -           |
| `s3`        | aws-cli (`>= 1, ~> 2`)<br />tar<br/>sha1sum | aws-cli (`>= 1, ~> 2`)<br />tar<br />shasum | -           |

### S3

This plugin uses AWS S3 cp to cache the paths into a bucket as defined by environment
variables defined in your agent.

```yml
steps:
  - plugins:
    - gencer/cache#v2.2.1:
        backend: s3
        key: "v1-cache-{{ checksum 'Podfile.lock' }}"
        s3:
          profile: "my-s3-profile"
          bucket: "my-unique-s3-bucket-name"
        paths: [ "Pods/", "Rome/" ]
```

The paths are synced using Amazon S3 into your bucket using a structure of
`organization-slug/pipeline-slug/cache_key.tar`, as determined by the Buildkite environment
variables.

### rsync

You can also use rsync to store your files using the ``rsync_storage`` config parameter.
If this is set it will be used as the destination parameter of a ``rsync -az`` command.

```yml
steps:
  - plugins:
    - gencer/cache#v2.2.1:
        backend: rsync
        key: "v1-cache-{{ checksum 'Podfile.lock' }}"
        rsync:
          path: '/tmp/buildkite-cache'
        paths: [ "Pods/", "Rome/" ]
```

The paths are synced using `rsync_storage/cache_key/path`. This is useful for maintaining a local
cache directory, even though this cache is not shared between servers, it can be reused by different
agents/builds.

### tarball

You can also use tarballs to store your files using the ``tarball_storage`` config parameter.
If this is set it will be used as the destination parameter of a ``tar -cf`` command.

```yml
steps:
  - plugins:
    - gencer/cache#v2.2.1:
        backend: tarball
        key: "v1-cache-{{ checksum 'Podfile.lock' }}"
        tarball:
          path: '/tmp/buildkite-cache'
          max: 7 # Optional. Removes tarballs older than 7 days.
        paths: [ "Pods/", "Rome/" ]
```

The paths are synced using `tarball_storage/cache_key.tar`. This is useful for maintaining a local
cache directory, even though this cache is not shared between servers, it can be reused by different
agents/builds.

## Cache Key Templates

The cache key is a string, which support a crude template system. Currently `checksum` is
the only command supported for now. It can be used as in the example above. In this case
the cache key will be determined by executing a _checksum_ (actually `sha1sum`) on the
`Podfile.lock` file, prepended with `v1-cache-`.

## Hashing (checksum) against directory

Along with lock files, you can calculate directory that contains multiple files or recursive directories and files.

```yml
steps:
  - plugins:
    - gencer/cache#v2.2.1:
        backend: tarball
        key: "v1-cache-{{ checksum './app/javascript' }}" # Calculate whole 'app/javascript' recursively
        tarball:
          path: '/tmp/buildkite-cache'
          max: 7 # Optional. Removes tarballs older than 7 days. 
        paths: [ "Pods/", "Rome/" ]
```

For example, you can calculate total checksum of your javascript folder to skip build, If the source didn't changed.

Note: Before hashing files, we do "sort". This provides exact same sorted and hashed content against very same directory between builds.

## Keeping caches for `X` days

To keep caches and delete them in -for example- 7 days, use tarball storage and use `tarball_keep_max_days`. On S3 side, please use S3 Policy for this routine. Each uploaded file to S3 will be deleted according to your file deletion policy.

** For S3**, Due to expiration policy, we just re-upload the same tarball to refresh expiration date. As long as you use the same cache, S3 will not delete it. Otherwise, It will be deleted from S3-side not used in a manner time.

## Roadmap

+ Adding support for Windows.
+ Google Cloud Cache Support.
